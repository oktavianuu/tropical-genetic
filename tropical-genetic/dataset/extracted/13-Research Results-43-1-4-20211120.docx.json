E.coli is one of the pathogenic bacteria present in drinking water that has poor quality. When it enters the body it can cause symptoms of diarrhea, fever, vomiting and others. The purpose of this study was to create a specific primer for E.coli that can be used to detect E.coli and determine the optimum temperature of primer annealing. Researchers do a new primer design because the existing design does not necessarily produce the same results due to various factors of different experimental conditions. The primer design was carried out on an in silico-based and had to meet the criteria for a good primer because it would be used in vitro. E.coli gene sequences was aligned with Shigella sp. using Pairwise Alignment. Primer candidates were analyzed using NCBI's Primer3 and Geneious Prime tools. The result is that the first primer pair is forward 5'–ATGCAGTGGTTCCTTATCTCACA-3' reverse 5'- ATCCTTAATGGCACTGCGCT-3', amplifying the amplicons along 417 bp in the yraJ gene. The second primer pair, forward 5'-CAGAACGTTTTTCATTCAGCAGG-3' reverse 5'-GCCACTACCAGATCGAGTCA-3' amplifies the 573 bp amplicon in the rne gene. The optimum annealing temperature for both pairs of primers was 59.5oC.",

Refill Drinking Water Depot (DAMIU) took advantage of this opportunity to be used as a business field to help the community meet the needs of cheap and affordable drinking water. The use of drinking water managed by DAMIU must pay attention to the quality and feasibility of drinking water (Agustia et. al., 2019). There are many refill drinking water depots and they are easy to find in the community, but due to the lack of information in the form of the manufacturing process, licensing and monitoring of the depot, many people doubt the quality and feasibility of the water (Athena, Sukar & Haryono, 2004). If the quality of drinking water is bad, it will certainly have an impact on the health of the body that consumes it. Poor quality water will be a source of habitat for living bacteria and also a medium for the spread of certain diseases such as diarrheal disease (Winata & Hartantyo, 2013). If drinking water is found to have pathogenic microbes, it means that the water has been contaminated during the management process (Raharja, 2015).",

The presence of E.coli is allowed and the total coliform bacteria is zero in the sample (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, 2010). For this reason, it is necessary to develop a detection method for pathogenic microbial contamination that detects the presence of indicator microbes. If the indicator microbe present in food or drink is within certain limits, it indicates that the food or drink has been exposed and allows the proliferation of pathogenic microbes. So that these microbes are used as indicators for the safety and microbiological quality of the products consumed (BPOM, 2008).",

E. coli is a bacterium that causes symptoms of diarrhea, fever, vomiting and so on (Entjang, 2003). E.coli will become pathogenic bacteria when it is not in the large intestine because the intestine is its natural habitat for life (Melliawati, 2009). E.coli is a rod-shaped bacterium with a length of about 2 micrometers and a diameter of 0.5 micrometers. E.coli is able to survive in a temperature range of 20-40oC with an optimum temperature of 37oC. E.coli is included in Gram negative bacteria (Sutiknowati, 2016). E.coli can not live in water and soil for a long time compared to other pathogenic bacteria. So that if E.coli is detected in the sample, it will indicate the possibility of other pathogenic bacteria (Agrippina, 2019).",

However, this method still has several weaknesses, such as the culture technique takes a relatively long time and is quite difficult to culture the microorganisms in differentially selective media (Abd-El-Haleem, et. al., 2003). The other technique is using the PCR technique, because this method has several advantages that are more profitable than the microbiological method. Because the PCR method does not require a long time in the process and specificity, efficiency is also very high accuracy (Pesurnay, 2018).",

However, prior to doing this, primers must be made first by designing specific E.coli primers, PCR in silico and optimizing the primer annealing temperature to be able to detect E. coli bacteria in refilled drinking water samples to be tested. Researchers design new primers because existing primer designs do not necessarily have the same results, there are many factors in different experimental conditions such as DNA template extraction methods, reagents and types of thermocyclers and PCR programs used. The advantage of designing new primers is that researchers can ensure their performance in optimizing methods and avoiding process or experimental data failures (Bustin & Hugget, 2017). In addition, the genomic sequences of E.coli and Shigella sp. Castellani and Chalmers, 1919 have a very high degree of similarity so that generally preexisting primary E.coli sequences can also amplify Shigella sp. therefore, in this study, it is necessary to re-design specific primers for E. coli as indicator microbes. Therefore, as a strategy to obtain specific primers for E.coli, the genomic sequence of E.coli will be aligned with Shigella sp. using Pairwise Alignment in BLASTn NCBI then regions specific for E.coli will be used as primary candidates.",
